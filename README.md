# Final-Project
Our team name is the Cyber Girls (Group 35).

Team members:

Description:
This is a repository containing our work for the Final Project. Our metric was the prettiest neighborhood based on amount of acres, median home values, and the amount of trees.

Links to Data Sets:
Amount of Acres/Median Home Values: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods-with-snap-data/resource/bce22c26-9d3e-4e3f-8405-a35c4b7765b6
Trees: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees

Our repository contains our personal notebooks, where we each analyzed our own data sets, this ReadMe file, and our combined repository where we compared our data sets and collectively decided on the best neighborhood based on our metric.
